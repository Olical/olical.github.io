		<description><![CDATA[This latest version of sync.sh relies on neovim https://github.com/Olical/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/.config/nvim/sync.sh#L11-L12

If you want to use regular Vim you&#039;ll have to go back a few commits (could be a lot...) to the time where it was still based on normal Vim. I think the package manager and autocompletion I use also rely on neovim features. So they&#039;re not compatible I&#039;m afraid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@OliverCaldwell:disqus sorry to bother again, but I&#039;ve still been having issues. Could it be because I&#039;m on a Mac and not Arch? I figured it&#039;d work out since it&#039;s all unix-based... but maybe not. I&#039;m trying to just do regular vim first, but when I run sh /path/to/sync.sh my terminal just flashes red for a second and returns to the prompt. when I vim into a js file I still just get regular vim, no coloring etc. Any thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oliver, that&#039;s an excellent response, thank you! I think I&#039;ll go ahead and play around with both and see how I like them. Much obliged for the instructions with the sync script so I can set that up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, that&#039;s a matter of taste. I use neovim because I kind of like where the project is going, although I spend most of my day in http://spacemacs.org/ now, which again, is just taste. It&#039;s got good tooling for lisp and it behaves like Vim, so I&#039;m happy with it.

Vim 8 and neovim both offer great things and I think both are good, maybe go across what Vim 8 added and what neovim offers, decide if it&#039;s worth the hassle of switching things.

The makefile is mainly for my Arch Linux stuff, the only thing you actually need to run from there is the sync script (./neovim/.config/nvim/sync.sh for neovim, but basically the same for normal vim). So all you need to do is copy that directory in (or use stow to symlink it) and run sync.sh.

If you want to run neovim you can run it alongside vim, why not try it and go back to vim if you have issues. They&#039;re almost the same to the end user, but some newer plugins only work in one or the other since both add really neat new APIs for doing things like autocompletion without locking the program up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks for the response! Before I go ahead and run that, I noticed in the newest version of your dotfiles, vim is gone and you&#039;re using neovim instead. I&#039;m trying to stay cutting-edge, so if I take that dotfiles folder, removed everything but neovim, Makefile, and packages.txt, and then removed all lines from packages.txt except the neovim and python ones. If I ran the Makefile, would that work?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey there, that&#039;s actually something I keep in my home folder. I&#039;m sorry, I thought I made it optional so it wouldn&#039;t throw if it didn&#039;t exist, apparently not.

touch ~/.vimrc_local should do the trick I think. It&#039;s just a file where you can store machine specific tweaks since I use the same config on multiple laptops.]]></description>
