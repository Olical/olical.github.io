		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using this right now and it works okay. https://www.amazon.co.uk/MINIX-NEO-USB-C-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B01ANITHVQ

The HDMI port is terrible and the slightest vibration will cause the screen to flicker. Nothing to do with the laptop or USB-C though, just shoddy hardware (for Â£60!). I use a cable that has a male DVI at one and and a male HDMI at the other.

I run this script to dock and undock from my desk when I connect or disconnect everything. https://github.com/Olical/dotfiles/blob/95ea0e948fb83c200c1acc865d6118265e6f6b7d/i3/.i3/docker.sh

It performs xrandr magic and also swaps my left and right mouse buttons around. When I&#039;m in desktop mode I have the &quot;left click&quot; on the right, because I&#039;m left handed. When it&#039;s in laptop mode I need the left click on the left because I&#039;m not that much of a monster.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you updated your kernel ever since? I&#039;ve just bought xps 13 9343 an week ago, an the sound is not working on 4.6.3 neither on lts (4.4-13). I&#039;ve tried recompiling the 4.6.3 kernel with acpi override (hda sound) and its irrelevant. Right now Im compiling lts (4.4-13) with it and I will tell you if it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So since you have to change the broadcom card in the standard version, would you recommend to buy the Developer Edition with Intel card instead? Or are there bigger differences between those versions? ]]></description>
