> Warning! This project has been replaced by my new [blog](https://github.com/Olical/blog) project, it's a custom static site rendering from AsciiDoc. It completely supersedes this repository and contains all of the posts as well as some new ones, check it out! (same domain though)

# Oliver Caldwell's blog

This is the source for my blog, [oli.me.uk][blog]. It's a static site built by [Cryogen][] and hosted on GitHub pages.

The `cryogen` directory contains all the tooling for generating the new static site at the top level of the repository.

## The WordPress hangover

I used to have a WordPress blog before this one, but I didn't want to attempt to convert the posts into markdown, so I took a static snapshot of it. This means all existing links still work but there's no PHP involved.

The only annoying thing is that there's now lots of static files in the root directory just to support the old site.
