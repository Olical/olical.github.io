		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for this, it means a lot. I hope you can learn from either my mistakes or my non-mistakes :)

I hope I can teach more in the future too! I&#039;ll have more to say on Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs in the coming months. Many interesting topics in there.

Happy learning!]]></description>
