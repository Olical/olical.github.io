I've used [Spacemacs][] since I started working with [Clojure][] a few years ago, it's an extremely powerful system on par with full IDEs such as [Cursive][]. I highly recommend either of these tools to the budding Clojure(Script) developer, they will carry you as far as you need to go and beyond.

The reason I have drifted back to [Vim][] ([Neovim][] specifically) is because I never felt quite at home within [Emacs][], which Spacemacs is built atop of. I wrote JavaScript, among other languages, in Vim for around five years before I began really studying Clojure, Vim and it's nuances are pretty deeply buried within my brain and muscle memory (if that's actually a thing).
