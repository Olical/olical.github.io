		<description><![CDATA[You can do it, but you need a tiny bit of JavaScript. You could have your JavaScript add a class to an element called `hidden` or something like that. This will start to fade the element out or do what ever you want it to do. The JavaScript can then listen for the transition end event which it can set `display: none;` or add another class to completely hide it. I&#039;ve built you a little example of how I would do it. I hope this helps: http://jsfiddle.net/Wolfy87/cSXMZ/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love what this can do and it&#039;s perfect for my book excerpt options.  However, it just shows the radial and full content without the accordion effect.  I&#039;m new at this, so I know I&#039;m doing something wrong.  What do I need to do (copy/paste info) in order to have someone review? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One possible accessibility issue you&#039;ll run into is that you cannot &#039;tab&#039; on to the radio buttons as they are hidden (and the label won&#039;t get picked up by tabbing either). 


This seems like a great technique though overall. I would love to know if there is a way around the tabbing issue - as I&#039;m gearing up to integrate this method into my current toolkit.

I also tried using checkboxes which work in much the same way except with the added function of being able to toggle all items open at the same time.]]></description>
