				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can probably begin to get to the bottom of most internal Emacs problems with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Function-Debugging.html">debug-on-entry</a>. This function prompts for a function name interactively (which also hooks into helm) and will essentially set a breakpoint within Emacs on that function. When it is called you&#8217;ll get to see what functions were called and with what arguments.</p>
<p>This came out of my <em>:w</em> (evil write) stopping working today, it was down to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/commits/b156bd87585a93acce503247bfb3cbd41fc5e179">this commit</a> and fixed in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/commits/ce5eaa56c30271e212bbfa1b5805d59cb064e07f">this one</a>. The prompt response was much appreciated.</p>
<p>But you can use debug-on-entry on the offending function (which you should be able to find in the messages buffer) to set a breakpoint and walk up the stack to see if you can understand the problem better. It was interesting in my case but didn&#8217;t solve the issue, I just commented on the GitHub mirror of the commit and the author fixed it for me. Open source rules.</p>
