				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a title="Giving Emacs another chance" href="/2015/03/02/giving-emacs-another-chance/">my post</a> from last night says, I&#8217;m giving Emacs another go. And in an even older post, when I was trying Emacs for the first time, I show <a title="Making package.el behave like Vundle" href="/2014/10/20/making-package-el-behave-like-vundle/">my approach to getting my packages syncing like I do in Vim</a> (spoiler alert: It didn&#8217;t work very well). My Vim setup will remove unused packages, update what I currently have and then install any that are missing through <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles/blob/85937edfd5330cc0478a3165f6aa7d132173ef57/vim/.vim/update.sh">this simple script</a> and the use of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#!/usr/bin/env bash

vim +"PlugSnapshot $HOME/.vim/revert.sh" +PlugUpgrade +PlugClean! +PlugUpdate +qa</pre><p>I&#8217;ve been yearning for the same, or at least similar, experience in Emacs. Without good package management and automatic cleaning I just don&#8217;t want to use it. The main reason for this is that I use <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> across multiple machines and I can&#8217;t be dealing with package hell when I pull my dotfiles at work each morning. I need everything to always represent my declarative list of packages in my dotfiles perfectly.</p>
<p>After a late night Elisp session yesterday, which ended around 1am, I found a very concise approach to manage my packages in a satisfactory way. It&#8217;s nowhere near as clean, efficient and parallel as my Vim set up, but it gets the same result. It&#8217;s a shame it&#8217;s not shiny and perfect, but sometimes good enough is good enough. <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles/blob/85937edfd5330cc0478a3165f6aa7d132173ef57/emacs/.emacs.d/sync.sh">My synchronisation script for Emacs</a> isn&#8217;t as short and sweet, but it does the job.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#!/usr/bin/env bash

PACKAGES=~/.emacs.d/config/packages.el
ELGET=~/.emacs.d/el-get/

if [ ! -d $ELGET ]; then
    mkdir $ELGET
    git clone git@github.com:dimitri/el-get.git $ELGET/el-get
fi

emacs --batch -l $PACKAGES -f dotfiles-sync
rm ~/.emacs.d/el-get/.loaddefs.*
emacs --batch -l $PACKAGES</pre><p>This will fetch <a href="https://github.com/dimitri/el-get">el-get</a> if required, boot Emacs once to perform the sync operation (fetch, update and clean), remove the loaddefs because they get out of syncÂ <em>really</em> easily (so if magit was removed, for example, it would still appear in my tab complete although I couldn&#8217;t execute any of the commands, that&#8217;s loaddefs being old) and finally launch it again to generate the new loaddefs file ahead of time. The real magic happens in <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles/blob/85937edfd5330cc0478a3165f6aa7d132173ef57/emacs/.emacs.d/config/packages.el">my packages configuration module</a> though.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get/el-get")
(require 'el-get)

(setq dotfiles-packages '())

(defmacro bundle (name &amp;rest content)
  `(progn
    (add-to-list 'dotfiles-packages ',name)
    (el-get-bundle ,name ,@content)))

(defun dotfiles-sync ()
  (el-get-cleanup dotfiles-packages)
  (el-get-update-all t))

(bundle monokai-theme
        (load-theme 'monokai t))</pre><p>That little <em>bundle</em> macro is a passthrough to the <em>el-get-bundle</em> macro, but before it passes the forms off to it the name is stored in a list. That list becomes the &#8220;required packages&#8221; list which we use when performing a cleanup of packages. Basically, when you run <em>el-get-cleanup</em> (which appears to be undocumented? I found it by perusing the source) you can pass it a list of packages <em>not</em> to remove. This list is obtained by intercepting my declarative list of dependencies. Neat, right?</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve done it, I&#8217;ve got Emacs packages working the way I needed them to for me to take it seriously. It works just like my Vim + vim-plug setup, albeit not as elegantly. It&#8217;s a small sacrifice to make for all the lisp I could ever ask for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s parenthesis time now.</p>

Sadly, <a href="http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Package.el">package.el</a> doesn&#8217;t seem to do this and expects me to use some silly text based menu as well as remembering to keep every single one of my packages in sync. If I remove it from one, I need to remove it from the rest by hand. <strong>NO.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not having any of that.</p>
<h2>Installing missing packages</h2>
<p>This one&#8217;s easy enough to solve and many people have many solutions. I have a function, <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles/blob/88926d0f8ad581f4a4953d6fdea40d812638b17d/emacs/init.el#L97-L103"><em>dotfiles-sync</em></a>, which will get the latest package lists from <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net/">MELPA</a> (and a few others) and installs all packages I currently don&#8217;t have locally. Simple enough and very effective, even if it does require a few reboots to get them all installed, still trying to work that one out.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">;; Main package list to fetch from melpa.
(defvar dotfiles-packages
  '(evil

;; WAY MORE PACKAGE CONFIGURATION</pre><p>So here I have a list of packages, a function to fetch them and a macro that I use to wait until each package is loaded before I configure them. To update my packages I have to go into the text based menu, mark out of date packages for upgrade and then execute it all (<em>M-x list-packages RET U x</em>). Despite this being cumbersome and annoying, this appears to be the only way right now.</p>
<h2>The other problem, pruning</h2>
<p>So I can install and update fairly easily, albeit not perfectly, but I&#8217;m still lacking the ability to prune old packages that I no longer have listed in my <em>init.el</em> file. My only main requirement for this process is that it executes as part of my synchronisation. Luckily the problem frustrated me enough to construct a solution, now my Emacs package management isn&#8217;t that far behind that of Vim / Vundle&#8217;s, but it still doesn&#8217;t feel quite a smooth. I&#8217;ll take what I can get.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">;; Package pruning tools.

<p>Edit: I created a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2jtojf/packageel_didnt_prune_my_unused_packages_so_i/">post</a> on the Emacs subreddit in which syl20bnr ran with the idea and made it far better. The concept can now be found within <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/c517424032a9f43e1365d9f157dc246b38debda1/core/contribsys.el#L245-L270">the spacemacs repository</a> and it looks great!</p>
