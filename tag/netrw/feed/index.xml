				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post I&#8217;m going to aim for an MVP that may not be the most usable but can serve as a proof of concept. This version will only run when you call a command and have minimal configuration. Polishing of the plugin will come after in the form of help pages, configuration and automatic execution.</p>
<p>The very first step involves creating the main plugin file which is loaded from the runtime path and defines commands, automatic as well as normal. These commands will point to a namespaced file which will be loaded on demand, this is all contained within the <code>autoload</code> directory.</p>
<h3>The initial files</h3>
<p>First <code>plugin/netrw_signs.vim</code>, which points to an autoload function.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">command! NetrwSigns :call netrw_signs#SignBuffer()</pre><p>Then we can create the &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; function on the other end of this command in <code>autoload/netrw_signs.vim</code>.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">function! netrw_signs#SignBuffer()
  echo "Hello, World!"
endfunction</pre><p>After adding the project directory to my runtime path (<code>set rtp+=$HOME/.../vim-netrw-signs</code> in <code>~/.vimrc</code>) I can open Vim and execute <code>:NetrwSigns</code> to run my new function. This prints &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; to the bottom of my screen. Obviously the plugin still lacks a fair bit of functionality.</p>
<p>I will also add a way to fetch the version number, as I did with vim-enmasse.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">" plugin/netrw_signs.vim
command! NetrwSignsVersion :echo netrw_signs#GetVersion()

" autoload/netrw_signs.vim
function! netrw_signs#GetVersion()
  return "1.0.0"
endfunction</pre><p>Next, we must build an implementation behind the <code>SignBuffer</code> function, so that involves building the entire thing. No big deal. But first, let&#8217;s test this stupidly simple version function in <code>tests/version.vader</code>.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">Before (set up regular expression):
  let versionRegExp = '\v\d+.\d+.\d+'

Execute (can print the version number with the command):
  redir =&amp;gt; messages
  NetrwSignsVersion
  redir END

  let result = get(split(messages, "\n"), -1, "")

  Assert result =~# versionRegExp

Execute (can get the version number with the function):
  Assert netrw_signs#GetVersion() =~# versionRegExp</pre><p>I also had to add my project folder to my runtime path to get this to work in <code>test.sh</code>.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">vim -Nu &amp;lt;(cat &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
filetype off
set rtp+=$vader
set rtp+=. &amp;lt;-- This thing.
filetype plugin indent on
EOF) +Vader tests/*.vader</pre><p></p>
<h3>High level testing</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to use my tests to define how the plugin will actually work. Some may say that I&#8217;m driving my development with tests. These will be high level but provide me with all the checks I need to make sure my basic configuration is actually producing the desired results and signs. One of the best things about writing the tests up front is that my configuration will be thought out in a way that makes sense from the users perspective, I&#8217;ll then work back from there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my preliminary configuration I&#8217;ll be using in my root high level tests. Below it is my thought process in pseudo-English.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">let g:netrw_signs_checks={
  \'contains-hyphen': 'ContainsHyphen',
  \'contains-upper-case': 'ContainsUpperCase'
\}
let g:netrw_signs_styles={
  \'error': 'text=&amp;gt;&amp;gt; texthl=ErrorMsg'
  \'warning': 'text=&amp;gt;&amp;gt; texthl=WarningMsg'
\}
let g:netrw_signs_bindings={
  \'contains-hyphen': 'error',
  \'contains-upper-case': 'warning'
\}</pre><p></p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">Let the check contains-hyphen use the function ContainsHyphen.
Let the check contains-upper-case use the function ContainsUpperCase.

Let the error sign have these arguments passed to it's definition within Vim.
Let the warning sign have these arguments passed to it's definition within Vim.

Let the contains-hyphen check show the error sign if it returns true.
Let the contains-upper-case check show the warning sign if it returns true.</pre><p>As far as I can tell so far, this is all the logic I will need to configure the plugin. This should allow the user more than enough power, it will even allow you to hook into git, which is my end goal. The one thing I&#8217;m not so sure about right now is how I&#8217;ll execute the functions by name reliably. It should &#8220;just work&#8221;, but I may encounter some problems with that later on. I also need to work out the format for the check functions return values.</p>
<p>My current thinking is for each check function to either get called once with each line of the netrw buffer or, alternatively, to pass an array of all lines to the function. The function would then run a map over that array and return an array of booleans. The one line approach allows for simple functions and the heavy lifting on my end (probably involving maps), the other approach involves heavier check functions but the chance for optimisations if you had to call <code>git status</code> for every line, for example.</p>
<p>With those implementation details in mind, I&#8217;ll write my first tests against this configuration.</p>
<h3>Uh oh&#8230;</h3>
<p>It is at this point that I realised how much work will actually be involved to get a working and tested MVP that didn&#8217;t die when it encountered tiny changes in netrw configuration. I don&#8217;t have time for this sort of return on investment, so I&#8217;m shelving this little project to learn about Clojure and algorithms using this stack of books I&#8217;ve accumulated. I&#8217;m obviously going to push everything I&#8217;ve got so far alongside these few posts, and I may even come back to it one day. Until then, sorry vim-netrw-signs, you&#8217;re dead to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my last post I focused on <a title="Building vim-netrw-signs: Introduction" href="/2014/08/11/building-vim-netrw-signs-introduction/">getting the repository and main files up and running</a>, here I&#8217;ll briefly touch on the satellite tooling I&#8217;m going to hook into to make the development a bit easier. Oh, also, I&#8217;m writing this from a cruise ship somewhere around Gibraltar.</p>
<h3>Travis</h3>
<p>So I created my <code>.travis.yml</code> file last time which gives me all the configuration I need to activate continuous integration testing. Because I went onto the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> website and activated the repository, every time I or any other push it will run the test suite.</p>
<p>So this will allow me to check my code on another environment, which is always fun and games when it comes to Vim, but also have pull requests pre-vetted for me. All PRs will be built and have their results displayed within the actual PR page. The Travis integration actually goes both ways.</p>
<h3>Waffle</h3>
<p>This is a tool from the guys behind <a href="https://www.rallydev.com/">Rally</a>, which is basically enterprise task management. <a href="https://waffle.io/">Waffle</a> is the free and open source oriented version which allows me to control my GitHub issues as to do lists on a sort of Kanban board. I&#8217;ve already used their automated PR generator that asks to add the &#8220;ready&#8221; task count to my readme. This will allow anyone viewing the GitHub repository to see what tasks are researched, locked down and ready to be worked on by anyone and everyone.</p>
<h3>Tools in summary</h3>
<p>So I have Travis executing tests on my remote GitHub repository using Vader and Waffle hooking into the GitHub issues system to provide task boards and organisation. Now I can plan out tasks, drag them around their various states and tag them then build them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably open long running tasks (this should be most feature branches) up as pull requests so that I get diff, comment and CI tooling all on one page. This gives other developers the chance to see my thought processes and comments as I go about building a feature. It should also show how many times I forget to push without running the test suite.</p>
<h3>Next up</h3>
<p>Diving into the VimL and actually building this beast. I&#8217;ll keep popping up for air and writing little bits about the development, but it&#8217;s going to be fairly high level on the whole with a lot of links to commits. This is because it would take about five years to complete if I talked about every line I wrote.</p>
<p>So the next post will be massive and code heavy but should show the actual construction of a Vim plugin, not just the tooling and extra services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought of another Vim plugin idea a while back at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/">Vim London</a>, which happens to be my second of such ideas, the first being <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/vim-enmasse">vim-enmasse</a>. My plan is to build this plugin over the coming weeks (probably months, ideally not years) and take you along for the ride with these brief posts. From <code>git init</code> to <code>git tag v1.0.0</code>. To begin with, here&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/vim-netrw-signs">the repository</a> and the <a href="232121235a31ee282d363ae331050f40f8dbdc38">initial commit</a>. As with all of my open source code now, it&#8217;s &#8220;licensed&#8221; under <a href="http://unlicense.org/">The Unlicence</a>.</p>
<p>This plugin is much like <a href="https://github.com/mhinz/vim-signify">vim-signify</a> or <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">syntastic</a> but for netrw, Vim&#8217;s built in file browser. This is inspired by the way that some super-massive IDEs will show parts of your folder structure that have been touched according to git. I want to create something that could hook into linters or version control systems to warn you about things when you drop into netrw from time to time. This becomes an easy thing to do and a frequent occurrence if you have something like <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar">vim-vinegar</a> installed.</p>
<p>So this will be quite generic with, probably, only git integrated to begin with. It will simply allow small composable modules to decide which files or folders should have signs attached to them. First thing&#8217;s first (after creating the repository)&#8230;</p>
<h3>Setting up the tests</h3>
<p>Yes, tests first. I used <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim">vader.vim</a> on vim-enmasse and I&#8217;ll be doing the same here, but this time from the very beginning. It can be integrated in such a way that you can run tests from your local command line and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, as I&#8217;ll be doing soon enough. I&#8217;ll start off by defining a script to initialise dependencies and run my test suite, which is stolen from <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/vim-enmasse/blob/835ec0bd794183514865943188990669511d546b/test/run">vim-enmasse&#8217;s</a> (mostly).</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">#!/usr/bin/env bash

vader=.vader

if [[ ! -d $vader ]]; then
	git clone https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim.git $vader
else
	cd $vader
	git pull
	cd ..
fi

vim -Nu &lt;(cat &lt;&lt; EOF
filetype off
set rtp+=$vader
filetype plugin indent on
EOF) +Vader tests/*.vader</pre><p>And then I dropped in the Travis config, just because it&#8217;s that easy.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">language: vim

before_script: |
  git clone https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim.git

script: |
  vim -Nu &lt;(cat &lt;&lt; VIMRC
  filetype off
  set rtp+=vader.vim
  set rtp+=.
  set rtp+=after
  filetype plugin indent on
  VIMRC) -c 'Vader! tests/*.vader' &gt; /dev/null</pre><p>So I have two scripts, one Travis will use to execute quickly on some headless machine, and another I will repeatedly run locally (probably within a tmux split). The first script will check if I have vader cloned yet and will go and fetch it if not. When it executes it will run the tests in a minimal Vim environment and then report the results through the quickfix list of the minimal Vim window. I may change this to just dump it&#8217;s output like the Travis version, I haven&#8217;t decided yet.</p>
<p>So now all I have to do is add a <code>*.vader</code> file to <code>tests/</code> and either or my two execution methods should run them in identical environments. I have to be careful to not let my highly customised Vim configuration leak through to my testing environment.</p>
<h3>Next</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll be adding my first hunk of source code, even if it&#8217;s a bit of autoload magic as well as a rudimentary test to check the Travis integration. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/vim-netrw-signs/commit/14e769dd281bffb6c7a77c30e6d33d2c65b47423">tonight&#8217;s last commit</a>. Baby steps are the way forwards.</p>
