				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I managed to use Emacs for one whole week of full-time JavaScript work, whilst only falling back to Vim for the odd tweak of JSON or configuration, I count that as a success. It&#8217;s shifted my opinion of it since I set up my package management and JavaScript tooling, you can find all of this within <a href="https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/init.el">my dotfiles</a>. It&#8217;s become far easier since I started to learn about vanilla Emacs key-bindings, the reason being that when I lost Evil mode for some buffers I was left high and dry.</p>
<p>The shift in mentality from my Vim workflow is interesting. I&#8217;ve moved away from tmux / tabs / splits and have begun leaning towards searching for buffers I want with <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a> and opening highly coupled files (such as tests) in splits. I&#8217;m yet to really use the terminal buffer, it doesn&#8217;t feel as smooth as my terminal + tmux combination yet. I&#8217;m also yet to get some form of git gutter and unimpaired style bindings set up. I haven&#8217;t managed to use it to resolve git conflicts yet either, I refer to Vim for that still. Git gutter doesn&#8217;t appear to work with my relative line numbers, there must be a way around it.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going to start on my Clojure setup for use with <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/">Brave Clojure</a>, we&#8217;ll see how that goes, I&#8217;d imagine rather well. Many thanks to those on twitter who convinced me to stick with it, I think it&#8217;s going to be great in the long run.</p>
