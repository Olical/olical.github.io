				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You only see the directive, controller or template. Sometimes parts are in the same place and you can make sense of it. A lot of the time they are disparate and hard to comprehend. I&#8217;m wasting time trying to understand how value X gets from A to B, let alone what happens to it along the way or at the other end. Or even what X actually is!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like Angular for various reasons after working with it closely for around a year. I think this is largely because of the constant weaving in and out of multiple files and DOM structures. There&#8217;s no continuity and clear zones to create or find things. I&#8217;m sure someone that cares enough will retort with an architecture that sort of looks alright, but it&#8217;s still string based soft bindings all over the place and mutation left, right and center.</p>
<p>I may be biased. I want to move towards ClojureScript and immutable data structures. If I can&#8217;t have ClojureScript I want to emulate the best things about it, Angular is very different to the world I want to be in.</p>
